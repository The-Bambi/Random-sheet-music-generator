# Random-sheet-music-generator

This project is aimed to generate a random sheet music, using lilypad & python. 

The goal is to be able to generate large amounts of random sheet music files and convert them to graphical format.

Eventually this is going to serve as a learning dataset for a neural network, which is supposed to split a sheet music for string quartet into 4 separate parts (vl1-vl2-vla-vlc).
